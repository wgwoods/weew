# weew - Will's Experimental Enarx Workspace

Hi! This is my playground repo for experimenting with a possible Enarx CLI /
client-server system / etc.

The code here is raw, unfinished, and not really ready to be published as
their own repo/crates, but I still don't want to lose it, so.. here it is!

**WARNING**: It doesn't really do anything yet. It might not even compile. And you shouldn't
trust it if it does. No warranty. For novelty use only. Do not eat. Light
fuse, get away.
